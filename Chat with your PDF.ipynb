During \\nthis conference, the audience reached a \\nconsensus that AI referred to the creation of \\nmachines with intelligence similar to that of \\nhumans.\\nAI development can be broadly categorized \\ninto three stages: ANI, AGI, and ASI. Artificial \\nNarrow Intelligence (ANI), also known as \\nweak AI, refers to the development of \\ncomputer systems that are designed to \\nperform a specific task or solve a particular \\nproblem. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), \\n - 2 - \\nA happy-suprised reaction by John Maccarthy (the founder of \\nAI), when he found out about AI for the first time. Assume that \\nthis was 1956  --v 5 --q 2 --s 750\\nA person scouting a book that is made out of AI --v 5 --q 2 --s \\n750 -also known as strong AI or human-level \\nAI, refers to the development of computer \\nsystems that can perform any intellectual \\ntask that a human can. Artificial Super \\nIntelligence (ASI) refers to the development \\nof computer systems that surpass human \\nintelligence and can perform intellectual \\ntasks that exceed human capacity.\\nThere are various Artificial Intelligence \\ntechnologies that are used in our daily \\nlives. Some examples include “smart \\nwriting” features that offer suggestions \\nfor email composition, spam message \\nclassifiers, and voice assistant applications \\nlike Amazon’s Alexa or Microsoft’s Cortana, \\nwhich utilize natural language processing.\\nArtificial intelligence applications possess \\nthe capability to continuously learn from \\nnew experiences and make deductions \\nbased on past experiences gathered from \\ndata. In so-doing, the machine is taught \\nhow to execute specific tasks based on the \\nknowledge it has acquired from such data.What is Artificial \\nIntelligence?\\nAI-generated image showing the reaction \\nof John McCarthy’s (founder of AI) when he \\ndiscovered Artificial Intelligence for the first time \\nin 1956.

The generator creates new \\ndata instances that resemble the training \\ndata, while the discriminator evaluates \\nwhether the generated data is similar to \\nthe training data or not. During training, the \\ngenerator tries to produce data that can fool \\nthe discriminator, while the discriminator \\ntries to distinguish between the generated \\ndata and the training data.A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type \\nof neural network architecture used for \\ngenerative modeling that employs both an \\nencoder and decoder network. The encoder \\nnetwork maps the input data into a latent \\nspace, while the decoder network maps the \\nlatent variables back into the original data \\nspace. By training the network to minimize \\nthe reconstruction error between the input \\nand output data, the VAE can learn the \\nunderlying structure of the data distribution \\nand generate new data samples from it.\\nGenerative AI has revolutionized numerous \\nindustries by generating data for training \\nmachine learning models, producing \\ntop-notch images and videos, developing \\nadvertising texts, conducting awareness \\ncampaigns, and scripting virtual assistant \\ndialogs for customer service and chatting. \\nHowever, despite its unique capabilities, \\nusers must carefully consider the strengths \\nand limitations of these cutting-edge \\napplications and choose them judiciously \\nbased on the task at hand.\\nNote: \\nThe guide is impartial and does not show any preference \\ntowards specific companies, institutions, or platforms. Its \\nprimary objective is to demonstrate the practical applications \\nof generative AI and how to leverage its potential benefits.

It \\ninvolves controlling how data is collected, \\nused, stored, shared, and disposed of \\nby organizations or entities that collect \\nor process that data. Data privacy is an \\nessential component of information security \\nand is governed by various laws, regulations, \\nand best practices aimed at ensuring the \\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of \\npersonal information.\\nData privacy is necessary for several \\nreasons. Firstly, it protects individuals’ \\npersonal information from being accessed, \\ncollected, and used without their knowledge \\nor consent. Secondly, it ensures that \\nsensitive information such as financial \\nrecords, medical records, and confidential \\nbusiness information is kept safe and secure. Thirdly, it helps prevent identity theft \\nand other forms of cybercrime. Additionally, \\ndata privacy is important for maintaining \\ntrust between organizations and their \\ncustomers, as well as for complying \\nwith legal and regulatory requirements. \\nWithout proper data privacy measures in \\nplace, individuals’ personal and sensitive \\ninformation can be compromised, leading to \\npotential harm and loss. \\nTransparency is crucial to data privacy \\nbecause it enables individuals to know how \\ntheir data is collected, processed, and used \\nby organizations. By being transparent, \\norganizations can provide clear and concise \\ninformation about their data privacy \\npractices, policies, and procedures. This \\nempowers individuals to make informed \\ndecisions about whether to share their \\npersonal information and to understand the \\npotential consequences of doing so. - 5 - \\nScientists wearing lab coats trying to \\npush the arabic language to a computer \\nto make it learn arabic for AI --v 5 --q 2 \\n--s 750 Insufficient Arabic Language Applications for \\nNatural Language Processing\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a \\nfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses \\non enabling computers to understand, \\ninterpret, and generate human language.
